    "#### Ans) A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database. \n",

    "`SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.` \n",
    "\n",
    "`SQL databases defines and manipulates data which are in structured format. On the other hand, a NoSQL database has dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`In almost all situations SQL databases are vertically scalable. This means that we can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU or SSD. But on the other hand NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that we handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in our NoSQL database.` \n",

    "Ans) A Primary key is a unique column we set in a table to easily identify and locate data in queries. A table can have only one primary key.\n",
